# Underwater Object Detection- YOLOv8-UC

Underwater object detection presents unique challenges due to *light attenuation*, *scattering*, and *complex environments*, which often result in reduced detection accuracy. This paper presents the implementation and analysis of YOLOv8-UC, an improved underwater object detection algorithm based on YOLOv8.

## Architecture
- A modified Dilation-wise Residual **(DWR)** C2f module to expand the receptive field for improved feature extraction.
- Large Separable Kernel Attention **(LSKA)** integration with SPPF to reduce information loss during feature fusion.
- A redesigned detection head utilizing **RepConv** to create a shared parameter structure.
- an **Inner-SIoU** loss function that employs auxiliary bounding boxes at different scales for improved bounding box regression.

## Highlights
- **Regional Residualization:** This step generates concise feature maps with different region sizes, using 3Ã—3 convolutions combined with batch normalization and ReLU activation.
- **Semantic Residualization:** Multi-rate dilated depth convolutions perform morphological filtering on the regional features, applying specific receptive fields to each channel.
- **Computational Cost:** While testing, the computational cost is reduced by using enhanced RepConv.
